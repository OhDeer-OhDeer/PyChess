# Chess
 Chess in Python!

HOW TO PLAY:
    Click and drag pieces. Terminal provides constant feedback on selections and explains invalid moves. When checkmated, press C to concede.

Notes:
    I made this as a way of re-learning simple python/pygame. This means the code is more than likely nightmarishly inefficient, but hey, I learned a lot and had some fun.
    There is no automatic checkmate function, though the game will limit movement options in accordance with whether the king is/will be checked. Checkmate is determined by players.

Known issues:
    -Game does not recognize diagonal checks by a promoted queen
    -En Passant does not work
